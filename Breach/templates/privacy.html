            <li>Optional metadata, such as category and tags, to categorize your submission.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not require or collect personal information (e.g., name, email) for story submissions unless you voluntarily include it within the content. Submissions are designed to be anonymous to protect whistleblowers.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Contact Form Submissions</h3>

            <li>The subject and message of your inquiry.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry and is not used for marketing or other purposes.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>We do not use cookies, trackers, or analytics tools to collect personal information. However, our servers may automatically log non-personal information, such as:</p>

            <li>Browser type and version.</li>
            <li>Pages visited and timestamps.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is used for security, troubleshooting, and improving the Website’s functionality and is not linked to identifiable individuals.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Review, verify, and publish user-submitted stories and evidence as exposés, in alignment with our mission to expose corruption.</li>
            <li>Respond to inquiries submitted through the contact form.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>3. Anonymity and Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>BreachXpress is dedicated to protecting the anonymity of whistleblowers and submitters. We employ technical and organizational measures, such as secure data storage and anonymization of submissions, to safeguard your identity. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Story submissions do not require personal information.</li>

            <li>Contact form data is encrypted during transmission and stored securely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, anonymity cannot be guaranteed in all cases, such as when we are legally required to disclose information (e.g., via court order). By submitting content, you acknowledge these limitations.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>We store submitted stories, evidence files, and contact form data on secure servers located in India. We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption and access controls, to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <p>We retain information as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stories and Evidence</strong>: Published exposés and their evidence are retained indefinitely to maintain a public record of corruption, unless removed for legal or ethical reasons.

            <li><strong>Contact Form Submissions</strong>: We retain contact form data for up to one year to ensure we can respond to inquiries, after which it is deleted unless required for legal purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong>: Server logs are retained for up to 90 days for security and troubleshooting, then deleted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to request deletion of your submission or contact data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@breachxpress.com">contact@breachxpress.com</a>. Note that published exposés may remain public to serve our mission.</p>

            <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We may use trusted third-party providers (e.g., hosting services) to store or process data on our behalf. These providers are bound by strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
        </ul>
